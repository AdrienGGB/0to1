 You're asking about what's still missing for a complete frontend update, especially given the new detailed lesson structure.

  Here's a breakdown of what's still needed or could be improved:

   1. Critical Missing Piece: API Endpoint for Single Lesson Content
       * The frontend/pages/course/[id].js now attempts to fetch detailed lesson content from /api/lessons/${selectedLessonId}?courseId=${id}.
       * This API endpoint does not exist yet. You need to create a new API route (e.g., frontend/pages/api/lessons/[id].js) that fetches a single lesson by its ID from your database and returns its full details,
         including the content field.

   2. Major Missing Features: Robust Custom Block Rendering
       * The current LessonContentRenderer.js provides only basic styling for :::tip, :::warning, :::hidden-answer, and :::quiz blocks.
       * `:::hidden-answer`: To render the details and summary HTML tags that the AI is expected to generate for this block, you'll need to ensure rehype-raw is used with react-markdown.
       * `:::quiz`: This is the most complex. The current implementation just displays "QUIZ (not interactive)". To make it functional, you'll need to:
           * Parse the quiz questions, options, and feedback from the Markdown.
           * Develop interactive React components for the quiz (e.g., radio buttons for options, logic to check answers and display feedback).

   3. Improvements:
       * Error Handling and Loading States: While basic states are in place, the UI feedback for loading and errors when fetching lesson content could be more refined.
       * Styling: The current inline styling is minimal. You'll want to implement proper CSS for a visually appealing and readable lesson display.
       * User Experience (UX): Consider how users navigate between the lesson list and the detailed lesson view. A more integrated navigation (e.g., a sidebar) might improve the experience.

  The most immediate and critical next step is to create the API endpoint to fetch a single lesson's detailed content.
